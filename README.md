# Clustering_Assignment

[Image Clustering](https://github.com/ashwinkd/Clustering_Assignment/blob/master/Image%20Clustering%20(Manual%20Algorithm%20Implementation).ipynb) is the solution for
clustering the handwritten MNIST character images. This consists of python implementation of KMEANS, KMEDOIDS, Hierarchical (Single, Complete & Average) as well as DBSCAN algorithms (implemented from scratch)

[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ashwinkd/Clustering_Assignment/blob/master/Clustering%20Assignment.ipynb) consists of Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization and Evaluation for Geometry, Density and Textual Data

[Number of clusters](https://github.com/ashwinkd/Clustering_Assignment/blob/master/Number_of_clusters.ipynb) consists of experiments to determine the optimum number of clusters using Elbow and Silhouette Methods.

[Algorithms](https://github.com/ashwinkd/Clustering_Assignment/tree/master/algorithms) consists of python implementation of KMEANS, KMEDOIDS, DBSCAN. Hierarchical Clustering for given data set as well as dummy dataset.

[Flatten](https://github.com/ashwinkd/Clustering_Assignment/tree/master/flatten_result) are the results of taking the image data as a 1D array.

[VGG16](https://github.com/ashwinkd/Clustering_Assignment/tree/master/vgg_result) are the results of taking the image data vector embedding given by a pre-trained VGG model.
